This repository is to hold my solutions to the projects corresponding to FreeCode Camp's course on Machine Learning in TensorFlow. ॱི★

These challenges were hard to accomplish but I'm delighted with the results! I have added the following projects:

• Rock, Paper, Scissors

• Cat and Dog Image Classifier

• Book Recommendation Engine Using Knn

• Predict health costs with regression
